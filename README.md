# Stock-Market-Prediction-Web-app
I developed a stock market prediction web application using Python, machine learning, and the Streamlit framework. This
application analyzes historical stock market opening and closing data from Yahoo Finance to predict trends for the
upcoming weeks and months.

It provides users with insights into future market movements, aiding in informed investment decisions. This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis and applying machine learning to real-world financial forecasting.
